The testing files for this program are split into two files, TestDB (tests the SQL queries and overall function of the db)
and TestComponents (which tests the function of the data base components)

Our testing classes use JUnit-4.12 to validate their results instead of print statements

TestDB tests a single basic SQL Statement by inserting a single record into a table and requesting its attributes.
MUST HAVE THE DATABASE RUNNING THROUGH startup SERVER SIMULTANEOUSLY TO WORK

TestComponents tests the BufferMgr class and by extension the BasicBufferMgr and Buffer classes.
Unfortunately, these tests are not fully functional because of the immense complexity of the interrelated backend components.
testBufferMgrPin is supposed to test that pinning is working properly and that a repinned block doesn't change the number
of available blocks
testBufferReplacement is supposed to test that the bufferMgr is keeping an accurate count on the number of available
buffers even when it needs to replace a block
